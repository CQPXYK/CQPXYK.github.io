开始休息就不想停止休息，开始学习就不想停止学习，当改变状态总是比保持状态更加令人抗拒时，就总是希望时间停止，万物寂静，没有波动，也没有干扰，可以随心所欲地一直保持当下状态。

这种心态本质还是一种逃避心态，拒绝事物的结束与变化，而寄希望沉溺于想象的安全区，在安全区可以不慌不忙的一直做当下希望做的事情，可人不能仅仅只是做自己想做的事，更多的是要做应该做的事，人总是要清醒一点，面对现实。

现实的时间并不静止，而是飞逝，现实的欲望也并不庞大，就像是一颗小小的钉子，钉子当然不会松垮到毫无存在感，也并非死死钉紧以至紧到麻木，我想应当是一颗正在被逐渐钉紧的钉子，一颗处于进行时的钉子正是存在感最强的钉子。

时间飞逝和欲望加深两相夹击之下，并不允许慢慢来这个字眼，必须要马不停蹄地去做那些清单上列好的排好队的应该要做的事情，长此以往，急迫又疲惫之时，挣扎就在于是继续清醒负重地尽最大努力来直面欲望，还是借逃避来将痛苦麻醉。

我不确定自己是否在精神上生了病，但我确实很渴望一种长期一个人待着不用说话不用见人的生活，我渴望独自一人不用洗脸不用梳头，渴望不出门时穿衣服只考虑是否舒服保暖，无需考虑是否美观正式，每周要去三天公司真的很难受，我渴望可以一直居家办公，或者有朝一日不用上班了那会有多快乐。

Whether resting or studying, once start, then don't want to stop. Since changing state is always more resistant than keeping it, I always wish the time could stop, things could be silent without fluctuations or interferences, and could remain as it is.

This mentality is essentially an escape mentality, refusing the change and end of things, just wish to indulge in the imaginary safety area where I can do whatever I want without haste. However, people can't just do something wanted, more is something needed, people need to be sober and face reality without dreams.

The time in reality is never static, but flies. The desire in reality is not huge, just like a tiny nail, not a nail which is so loosing that can be neglected, not a nail which is so tight that makes numb, I think it is a nail which is being gradually deepened. A nail in progress is the most obvious one.

Under the time flies and desire deepens, word of slow down is not being allowed. I need to do thing that are listed, queued and needed. As time goes, urgent and tired, the struggle is whether do the best to face desire with sober and weight, or numb myself by escape.
