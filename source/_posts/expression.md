# Vocabulary

I'm here to keep track of new words, new expression I've heard recently, and I don't remove them until I can spontaneously use them in my daily expression and thoroughly memorized them in all aspects of listening, speaking, reading and sentence-making. I expect this can be a vocabulary buffer that I can write into my brain later with no hurry and no lose.

# Grammar

Just want to help myself understand sentences better and learn how to make sentences.

## Clause Elements

Simple sentence (can't be split) is composed of the following elements.

- **Subject + Predicate Verb (intransitive )**
- **Subject + Predicate Verb (mono-transitive)+ Object**
- **Subject + Predicate Verb (ditransitive) + Object (indirect) + Object (direct)**
- **Subject + Predicate Verb (complex-transitive) + Object + Object Complement**
- **Subject + Predicate Verb (linking) + Predicative/Subject Complement**
- **Attributive** is generally used to modify **Subject** and **Object**
- **Adverbial** is generally used to modify **Predicate Verb**
- **Appositive** is generally used to repeat **Subject** or **Object** again with a different expression

Simple sentences are simply superimposed to form **compound sentences**.

Simple sentences (main clause) contain simple sentences (**subordinate clause**) (nesting relationship), then form complex sentences.

All sentence elements other than the **predicate verb** can be replaced with a **subordinate clause**.

## Parts of Speech

Parts of speech and clause elements are completely different concepts, can't draw equal signs between them. Clause elements can be served by different parts of speech.

|              |             |                  |                   |                  |
| :----------: | :---------: | :--------------: | :---------------: | :--------------: |
|  **Verbs**   |  **Nouns**  |   **Articles**   |   **Pronouns**    |  **Adjectives**  |
| **Numerals** | **Adverbs** | **Prepositions** | **Interjections** | **Conjunctions** |

Verbs are the core of English grammar. In addition to serving as a **predicate verb**, a verb can also serve as other clause elements, which is called a **non-predicate verb**. 

**Non-predicate verbs** can almost replace all **subordinate clauses** so as to simplify the sentence.

- full infinitive: to + verb
- bare infinitive: (to) verb
- gerund: verb-ing (n)
- present participle (active): verb-ing (adj)
- past participle (passive): verb-ed (adj)

## Verb Tenses and Moods

**Predicate verb** indicate the time (present, past, future, past future) of the action and the state (simple, progressive, perfect, perfect progressive) of the action, which are collectively called **tenses**.

**Auxiliary verb** is generally used in conjunction with **Predicate verb** to complete the expression of action **tenses** and **moods** (indicative, imperative, subjunctive). **Non-predicate verb** don't have property of **tenses** and **moods**.

- Simple Present Tense express a fact, habit, expectation
- Perfect Progressive Tense emphasis has been partially completed, and will continue
- The tenses of the main clause and subordinate clause should keep consistent, except for unchanging objective facts
- In contrast to the present fact, the subjunctive should be expressed in past tense (condition clause) and "would + verb" (main clause)
- In contrast to the past fact, the subjunctive should be expressed in "had + verb-en" (condition clause) and "would/should/could/might + have + verb-en" (main clause) 
- In contrast to the future fact, the subjunctive should be expressed in "should/would/could/might/were to + verb" (condition clause) and "should/would/could/might + verb" (main clause)
